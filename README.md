## Impleburg Study Case

- The Impleburg country, with an area slightly larger than the state of Mato Grosso do Sul
  in Brazil, has a network of good quality roads connecting as its cities. In the midst of an epidemic that devastated a region, the Ministry of Health of Impleburg had to adapt to the situation and choose to build centers for receiving suffering that need care. To this end, it is planned to establish service centers in some cities in order to optimize the use of human resources, materials and infrastructure. In this planning, it is intended to install these centers in the smallest possible number of cities so that the movement of patients is made directly between cities without going through intermediate cities and each road has to provide access to at least one city with a service center.
